# Project Objective
The purpose of this project is to create an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset, which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.

The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

The dashboard can be accessed from the link: https://nsheikh23.github.io/Plotly-challenge/
